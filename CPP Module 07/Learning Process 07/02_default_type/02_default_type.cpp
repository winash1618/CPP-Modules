/* In this program we are going to define an actual case. The one of the class template which i will name 
vertex. Let's assume that we are developing a video game say doom 7 then we need to write a class for our 
vertex allowing to represent points in the world before being able to shoot at them with heavy weapon. The
principle is that our vertex may be of multiple types we can imagine float or double vertex for example.
This means that we different types for one notion so we have the reflex. We know that we can write a class
 template and we will write the code once then the compiler will take care of the rest of the code for us
 regard less of the type we want to instatiate our template with.*/
